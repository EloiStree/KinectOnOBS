## Info
Kinect Viewer 2 & 360 For OBS
If you don't have a webcam near you but a Kinect One,  it is a good alternative.
But no driver allows you to use it easily. So I did this application for OBS.

**If you are maschistic and want to use your Kinect 360 as webcam**

 (DON'T INSTALL RUNTIME V2 & V1.8 ON THE SAME PC)
1. So you installed the runtime V1.8
2. Launch my kinect 360 app
3. Unplug & plug the kinect until you have image in the 360 app
4. Launch OBS and add the window to it
5. Install the Virtual Cam in OBS
6. Start the run of the [Virtual cam  in OBS](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam/releases)
7. Used it in Discord or Zoom
A. If none of this work for you Ping me on [Discord](https://eloistree.page.link/discord)
B. If you have a grey screen in the app. Close the app unplug and plug your Kinect 360. Check that the Runtime 1.8 is install and relaunch the app. (If I understand it is because the Kinect is already use by Window. So until you un-plug it I can't access it.)

Have fun.
Hope it helps
